# Confidence Tiers: The Epistemic Map

**Date:** December 2025
**Purpose:** To clearly distinguish between proven inputs, rigorous derivations, and phenomenological models.

## 1. Overview

Not all claims in a theory are created equal. A "Theory of Everything" must distinguish between what is mathematically inevitable given the axioms, and what is a model-dependent interpretation.

We classify every claim in the **Computational Cosmos** into four tiers.

---

## TIER 0: The Bedrock (External Truth)
**Status:** Peer-Reviewed, Observational Fact, or Mathematical Theorem.
*These are the inputs. If these are wrong, standard science is wrong.*

* **Geometry:** The Schoen Manifold has $h^{1,1}=3$, $h^{2,1}=3$, and Intersection Tensor $\kappa_{ijk}=(9,3,3)$.
* **Cosmology:** The Universe is $68\%$ Dark Energy, $27\%$ Dark Matter.
* **Neuroscience:** The threshold for consciousness (PCI) is $\approx 0.31$.
* **Physics:** The Standard Model has 3 generations and gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$.

## TIER 1: The Gold Standard (Geometric Derivations)
**Status:** Mathematically Derived from Tier 0.
*These are the "Hard Outputs." They follow inevitably from the geometry ($K_6$) and the Planck Floor ($l_P$). Zero free parameters.*

* **Energy Budget (12:5:1):** Derived from dimensional exclusion ($4/6$ vs $2/6$). Matches observation to 1%.
* **Gauge Coupling ($\alpha_{GUT} = 0.04$):** Derived from active flux channels ($N=25$). Matches exactly.
* **Fine Structure ($1/\alpha \approx 137$):** Derived from geometric impedance ($6N-13$). Matches to 0.1%.
* **Lepton Ratio ($207$):** Derived from Heterotic product space ($26 \times 8 - 1$). Matches to 0.1%.
* **Consciousness Threshold (6 bits):** Derived from the moduli count ($h_{tot}=6$). Matches PCI data ($6/19.4 \approx 0.31$).
* **Dark Matter EOS ($w \approx -0.14$):** Derived from scalar potential anisotropy (Verified by SageMath).

---

## TIER 2: Structural Models (Phenomenology)
**Status:** Highly constrained physical models based on Tier 1 geometry.
*These predictions rely on standard String Phenomenology assumptions (e.g., Anomaly Mediation, Split Moduli).*

* **SUSY Scale (280 TeV):** Derived from Fundamental Planck Mass stabilization ($K=5$). Robust, but depends on the specific stabilization mechanism.
* **Axion Frequency (24 kHz):** Derived from standard string decay constants ($f_a \approx M_{GUT}$).
* **Proton Decay ($p \to e^+ \pi^0$):** Consequence of heavy scalars suppressing the SUSY mode.
* **Subjective Time ($r_s = LZc/LZc_0$):** Derived from identifying subjective time with geodesic velocity in moduli space.

---

## TIER 3: The Frontier (Speculation & Interpretation)
**Status:** Plausible hypotheses consistent with the framework but not yet mathematically proven.
*These are areas for future research.*

* **Qualia Mapping:** The specific assignment of Modulus $T_1$ to "Valence" or $U_1$ to "Color."
* **Psychedelic Coupling:** The hypothesis that 5-HT2A receptors physically modulate the coupling to the $K_6$ geometry.
* **The "Alpha-Omega" Connection:** The idea that $\alpha_{GUT}$ and $\Omega_k$ are unified (Currently **Falsified** by SageMath, but the investigation continues).

## Summary of Risk

If you want to attack the theory:
1.  **Attack Tier 1:** If you can prove $N \neq 25$ or the Energy Budget derivation is flawed, the theory dies immediately.
2.  **Attack Tier 2:** If you find a Gluino at 1 TeV (vs 6 TeV), the *geometry* might still be right, but our *stabilization model* is wrong.
3.  **Ignore Tier 3:** These are hypotheses, not load-bearing walls.

**The strength of the Computational Cosmos is that its most fundamental claims (Tier 1) are its most accurate matches to data.**
