## File Manifest & Chronology

### 1. `The_Geometry_of_Form.md`
**The Genesis.**
Defines the Prepotential $F$ and Gradient Ideal.

### 2. `geom_form_report.md`
**The Topological Foundation.**
Establishes the Base ($c_2=12$) and the Singular Locus ($6t_1+t_2+t_3=0$).

### 3. `geom_form_report_02.md`
**The Success: "Double Seven" & Mass.**
Derives the "Double Seven" Identity ($M=7$) and the Geometric Mass Ratio ($2.87 \to 19.5$). **This remains the strongest result.**

### 4. `geom_form_criticalreport.md`
**The Failure: Vanishing Order.**
The mathematical audit. Proves that the Singular Locus is Order 1 ($I_1$), not Order 5 ($I_5$). This invalidates the explicit derivation of $SU(5)$.

### 5. `geom_form_theoretical_limits.md` (The Honest Conclusion)
**The Final Assessment.**
Replaces the "Synthesis."
* Acknowledges the "Double Seven" and Mass Hierarchy as valid.
* Classifies the Gauge Group as an **Anomaly**. The "Cost of 5" is real (due to the budget), but the current geometry does not explicitly solve it.
* **Verdict:** The model predicts a missing energy of 5 units but requires further tuning to manifest it as a gauge force.
