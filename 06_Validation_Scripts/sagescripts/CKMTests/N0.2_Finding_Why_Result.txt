PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE CABIBBO SUCCESS
======================================================================

λ₁ = 0.5262
√6 = 2.4495
λ₁/√6 = 0.2148
Correction factor (1 + A/6) = 1.0462
λ₁/√6 × (1 + A/6) = 0.2248
Observed λ = 0.225000000000000

6 = 2 × 3 = κ₂ × 2 = number of extra dimensions?
6 = κ₂ + κ₃ = 6

======================================================================
PART 4: VERIFY THE CP PHASE
======================================================================

Predicted: ρ̄ = A/√3 = 0.1599
Predicted: η̄ = A×√(8/5) = 0.3503

CP phase δ = arctan(η̄/ρ̄):
  Predicted: 65.47°
  Observed:  65.44°

Analytical: tan(δ) = η̄/ρ̄ = √(8/5) × √3 = √(24/5) = 2.1909
  δ = arctan(√(24/5)) = 65.47°

======================================================================
PART 5: NOW CHECK V_cb AND V_ub
======================================================================

V_cb = A_Wolf × λ²
  = 3A × (λ₁/√6)² × (1+A/6)²
  = 0.8308 × 0.05051
  = 0.04197
  Observed: 0.04180
  Agreement: 99.60%

V_ub = A_Wolf × λ³ × √(ρ̄² + η̄²)
  √(ρ̄² + η̄²) = √(0.1599² + 0.3503²) = 0.3851
  Observed √(ρ̄² + η̄²) = 0.3826
  V_ub = 0.8308 × 0.011353 × 0.3851
  = 0.003632
  Observed: 0.003600
  Agreement: 99.11%
