WHY √6 IN THE CABIBBO FORMULA?
======================================================================

The formula: λ = λ₁/√6 × (1 + A/6)
Both have '6' - is this the same 6?

======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 1: 6 = REAL DIMENSIONS OF CY3
======================================================================

  A Calabi-Yau threefold has:
  • 3 complex dimensions
  • 6 real dimensions

  The quark generations might "see" all 6 real dimensions,
  giving a √6 normalization factor.

  But wait - the CORRECTION factor (1 + A/6) also has 6.
  If it's the same 6, this suggests a Taylor expansion in 1/6.


======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 2: 6 = TOTAL MODULI COUNT
======================================================================

  h¹¹ + h²¹ = 3 + 3 = 6

  The moduli space has 6 dimensions total.
  Inter-generational mixing involves ALL moduli,
  hence normalization by √(total_moduli) = √6.

  This connects to our η̄ formula:
  • η̄ uses (h¹¹ + h²¹ - 1) = 5 (gauge-fixed)
  • λ uses (h¹¹ + h²¹) = 6 (un-gauge-fixed)

  Maybe: Cabibbo mixing is "before" gauge-fixing,
         CP violation is "after" gauge-fixing?


======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 3: GENERATION STRUCTURE
======================================================================

  3 generations × 2 (quarks vs antiquarks or up vs down) = 6

  Or: 3 up-type + 3 down-type = 6 quark flavors

  The CKM matrix mixes these 6 states, giving √6 normalization?


======================================================================
TESTING: WHAT IF WE DECOMPOSE THE FORMULA?
======================================================================
  Full formula: λ₁/√6 × (1 + A/6) = 0.2248
  Observed: 0.225000000000000

  λ₁/√(h¹¹+h²¹) = 0.2148

  Correction factor (1 + A/6) = 1.0462
  This is (1 + λ₁²/6) = (6 + λ₁²)/6

======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 4: NORMALIZATION FROM METRIC
======================================================================

  The moduli space metric has 6 independent directions.

  The W-P eigenvalues are: λ₁² = 0.2769, λ₂² = λ₃² = 0.8308

  Sum of eigenvalues: λ₁² + λ₂² + λ₃² = 1.9385 = 7A

  Trace of metric / dimensions = 7A/6 ≈ 0.3231

  Hmm, 7A/6 ≈ A × 1.167, close to correction factor 1.046?


======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 5: SPECIAL GEOMETRY
======================================================================

  In special geometry, the Kähler potential is:

  K = -log(i ∫ Ω ∧ Ω̄)

  The metric is G_ij̄ = ∂_i ∂_j̄ K

  At a symmetric point, the metric might have determinant ~ 1/6^n
  or trace ~ 6.

  Let's check: does √6 appear in the period normalization?


======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 6: COMPARE TO OTHER FORMULAS
======================================================================

  Pattern:
  • λ (1-2 mixing): uses h¹¹ + h²¹ = 6
  • A (2-3 mixing amplitude): uses h²¹ = 3
  • ρ̄ (1-3 real part): uses √h²¹ = √3
  • η̄ (1-3 imaginary/CP): uses b₃/(h¹¹+h²¹-1) = 8/5

  The 6 in Cabibbo connects BOTH Hodge numbers together,
  while the other parameters use them separately.

  This makes sense: Cabibbo (1-2 mixing) is the "largest" mixing,
  involving the full moduli space structure!


======================================================================
HYPOTHESIS 7: FIBER STRUCTURE
======================================================================

  The Schoen manifold is a fiber product: E × E → P¹

  Each elliptic curve E has 2 real dimensions (1 complex).
  The base P¹ has 2 real dimensions.

  Total: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 real dimensions ✓

  But more specifically:
  • Fiber: 2 dimensions × 2 curves = 4
  • Base: 2 dimensions
  • Fibration structure: 4 + 2 = 6

  The √6 might represent the "total fibration degrees of freedom"!


======================================================================
MOST LIKELY: h¹¹ + h²¹ = TOTAL MODULI SPACE
======================================================================

  CONCLUSION: √6 = √(h¹¹ + h²¹) = √(total moduli dimensions)

  The Cabibbo angle involves mixing across ALL moduli directions,
  hence the normalization by √(total_moduli).

  Compare to η̄ which uses (h¹¹ + h²¹ - 1) = gauge-fixed moduli.

  Physical interpretation:
  • 1-2 generation mixing (Cabibbo): sees full 6D moduli space
  • CP violation: sees 5D space after fixing one direction

  The "-1" in η̄ vs no "-1" in λ:
  • Cabibbo is a REAL rotation angle → full moduli
  • CP phase is a COMPLEX phase → needs one direction fixed for reference

  This is consistent with gauge-fixing interpretation!


======================================================================
NUMERICAL VERIFICATION
======================================================================
  λ = λ₁/√6 × (1 + A/6) = 0.22475  (original)
  λ = λ₁/√6 × (1 + A/3) = 0.23467  (correction with h²¹)
  λ = λ₁/√6 × 1 = 0.21484  (no correction)
  Observed: 0.22500

  The correction (1 + A/6) ≈ (1 + A/(h¹¹+h²¹)) improves the fit!
  So BOTH the √6 and the /6 come from h¹¹ + h²¹ = 6.

======================================================================
FINAL FORMULA
======================================================================

  λ = λ₁/√(h¹¹+h²¹) × (1 + λ₁²/(h¹¹+h²¹))

    = λ₁/√(h¹¹+h²¹) × (h¹¹+h²¹+λ₁²)/(h¹¹+h²¹)

    = λ₁ × (h¹¹+h²¹+A) / (h¹¹+h²¹)^(3/2)

  For h¹¹ = h²¹ = 3:

    = λ₁ × (6 + A) / 6^(3/2)

    = 0.5262 × (6.2769) / 14.6969

    = 0.2248

  Observed: 0.225000000000000
  Agreement: 99.89%
