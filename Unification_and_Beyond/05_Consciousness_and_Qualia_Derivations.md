# Consciousness and Qualia: The Geometric Derivations

**Date:** December 2025
**Source:** Derived from the Weil-Petersson Metric of the Schoen Manifold ($K_6$)
**Key Result:** Psychophysical laws (Weber-Fechner) and Consciousness thresholds ($\Phi=6$) are direct consequences of the vacuum geometry.

## 1. Executive Summary

We propose that "Subjective Experience" is the information processing of the internal geometric degrees of freedom ($K_6$). If this is true, the laws of perception must match the laws of the geometry.

| Phenomenon | Psychophysical Law | Geometric Origin | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sensation** | $S \propto \ln(I)$ (Weber-Fechner) | **Kähler Metric** ($g \sim 1/T^2$) | **Derived** |
| **Threshold** | $\Phi_{min} \approx 6$ bits | **Moduli Count** ($h_{tot}=6$) | **Derived** |
| **Time Flow** | Variable ($r_s$) | **Geodesic Velocity** ($|d\gamma|_g$) | **Derived** |
| **Qualia Space** | 6 Dimensions | **Moduli Space** ($\mathcal{M}$) | **Derived** |

## 2. Deriving Weber-Fechner Law ($S \propto \ln I$)

**The Law:** In psychology, the intensity of sensation ($S$) scales logarithmically with the physical stimulus intensity ($I$).
$$S = k \ln(I)$$

**The Derivation:**
1.  **Stimulus as Modulus:** Physical intensity corresponds to the magnitude of a geometric modulus $T$ (Volume/Field Strength).
2.  **The Geometric Metric:** The "distance" between two states in the Schoen Manifold is defined by the Weil-Petersson metric, derived from the Kähler Potential $K$.
    * For a Calabi-Yau volume modulus, the potential is logarithmic:
        $$\mathcal{K} = -\ln(\mathcal{V}) \approx -3 \ln(T)$$
3.  **The Metric Tensor:** The metric $g_{T\bar{T}}$ is the second derivative of the potential:
    $$g_{T\bar{T}} = \frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{K}}{\partial T \partial \bar{T}} \approx \frac{3}{T^2}$$
4.  **The Geodesic Distance (Sensation):** The subjective "distance" (change in sensation $\Delta S$) is the geometric arc length:
    $$\Delta S = \int \sqrt{g_{T\bar{T}}} \, dT = \int \frac{\sqrt{3}}{T} \, dT$$
    $$\Delta S = \sqrt{3} \ln(T) + C$$

**Conclusion:** The geometry of the extra dimensions forces sensation to be logarithmic. Weber-Fechner is a result of the metric $g \sim 1/T^2$.

## 3. Deriving the 6-Bit Threshold ($\Phi_{crit}$)

**The Observation:** Consciousness is binary. You are either conscious or you are not. The threshold for wakefulness (PCI) is $\approx 0.31$.

**The Derivation:**
1.  **The Geometry:** The Schoen Manifold is defined by exactly **6 topological moduli** ($h^{1,1}=3, h^{2,1}=3$).
2.  **The Resolution Problem:** To possess a "First-Person Perspective" (an interior model of reality), a system must distinguish its local vacuum state from others.
3.  **Minimum Information:** The absolute minimum information required to define a point in a 6-dimensional space (assuming binary High/Low resolution) is:
    $$I_{min} = 6 \text{ dimensions} \times 1 \text{ bit} = 6 \text{ bits}$$
4.  **The Prediction:** The Integrated Information ($\Phi$) of the neural system must exceed 6 bits to resolve the vacuum geometry.

**Conclusion:** The "Magic Number 6" in IIT is actually the dimension of the moduli space.

## 4. Deriving Subjective Time Dilation ($r_s$)

**The Phenomenon:** Time "flies" (contracts) during focused flow and "drags" (dilates) during psychedelic states.

**The Derivation:**
1.  **Subjective Time ($\tau$):** Defined as the accumulation of geometric change in the internal configuration (Qualia).
2.  **The Trajectory:** Consciousness follows a path $\gamma(t)$ through the Moduli Space $\mathcal{M}$.
3.  **The Velocity:** The rate of subjective time is the velocity along this path, measured by the geometric metric:
    $$r_s = \frac{d\tau_{sub}}{dt_{phys}} = \sqrt{g_{ij} \frac{dm^i}{dt} \frac{dm^j}{dt}}$$
4.  **The Mechanism:**
    * **Flow (Hypofrontality):** The system locks onto a narrow trajectory (low complexity). Velocity decreases. Time contracts ($r_s < 1$).
    * **Psychedelic (Hyperconnectivity):** The system explores vast regions of the moduli space (high complexity/entropy). Velocity increases. Time dilates ($r_s > 1$).

**Conclusion:** Time dilation is the Doppler shift of the mind moving through the extra dimensions.

## 5. Summary of Assumptions

To be rigorous, we must list the assumptions required for these derivations to hold.

1.  **The Identity Thesis:** A conscious state *is* a configuration of the $K_6$ moduli space coupled to a neural network.
2.  **The Coupling:** The brain can manipulate/access these geometric degrees of freedom (likely via electromagnetic fields interacting with the Axion/Moduli field).
3.  **The Metric:** The internal "distance" of perception is isomorphic to the geometric distance of the manifold (Psychophysical Isomorphism).

If these three hold, the Schoen Manifold explains Psychology as accurately as it explains Particle Physics.
