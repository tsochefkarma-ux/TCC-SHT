# The Universal Axion: Geometry of the Dark Sector

**Date:** December 2025
**Source:** Derived from Universal Kähler Modulus ($Im(T)$)
**Key Result:** Dark Matter is a single Axion species oscillating at **24 kHz**.

## 1. Executive Summary

The Standard Model has a "Strong CP Problem": why does the strong force preserve time-reversal symmetry so perfectly? The standard solution is the **Axion**.
The **Computational Cosmos** framework reveals that this Axion is not an arbitrary addition. It is the **imaginary component** of the extra-dimensional volume.

| Observable | Prediction | Current Search Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass** | $1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ eV | Unexplored (ADMX looks at $\mu$eV) |
| **Frequency** | $\mathbf{24 \text{ kHz}}$ | **VLF Radio Band** |
| **Abundance** | $\Omega_{DM} \approx 27\%$ | Requires $\theta_i \approx 10^{-3}$ |

## 2. Geometric Origin ($Im(T)$)

In Heterotic String Theory, every geometric modulus field $T$ (which controls the size of a cycle) is complex:
$$T = \text{Volume} + i \cdot \text{Axion}$$
* **Real Part:** Controls the coupling strengths ($\alpha_{GUT}$).
* **Imaginary Part:** An angular variable that shifts under gauge transformations. This is the **Axion**.

### 2.1 The Universal Axion
The Schoen Manifold has 3 Kähler moduli ($T_1, T_2, T_3$).
However, the **$Z_3 \times Z_3$ Quotient** imposes a permutation symmetry that forces them to evolve together:
$$T_1 \approx T_2 \approx T_3 \equiv T$$
**Result:** Instead of 3 distinct particles, the geometry produces **One Universal Axion** ($a$).

## 3. Mass Prediction ($10^{-10}$ eV)

The mass of a stringy axion is determined by the "Decay Constant" ($f_a$), which is set by the fundamental scale of the string coupling.

### 3.1 The Decay Constant ($f_a$)
In perturbative heterotic string theory:
$$f_a \approx \frac{M_P}{16\pi^2} \approx M_{GUT} \approx 10^{16} \text{ GeV}$$

### 3.2 The Mass Formula
The axion acquires mass via QCD instanton effects (the same mechanism that gives the proton mass, but suppressed by $f_a$):
$$m_a \approx \frac{m_\pi f_\pi}{f_a} \approx \frac{(0.135 \text{ GeV}) (0.093 \text{ GeV})}{10^{16} \text{ GeV}}$$
$$m_a \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-19} \text{ GeV} \approx \mathbf{1.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ eV}}$$

## 4. The Abundance (Anthropic Tuning)

With $f_a \approx 10^{16}$ GeV, a "natural" initial angle $\theta_i \sim 1$ would overproduce Dark Matter by a factor of 60,000, causing the universe to crunch immediately.

### 4.1 The Anthropic Window
Since we exist, we must live in a patch of the multiverse where the initial misalignment angle was small.
* **Required Density:** $\Omega_{DM} h^2 \approx 0.12$.
* **Required Angle:**
    $$\Omega h^2 \propto \theta_i^2 f_a^{1.18} \implies \theta_i \approx \mathbf{0.0014}$$

This is not fine-tuning; it is an observational necessity (like the distance of Earth from the Sun).

## 5. Experimental Target (The "Radio" Signal)

If Dark Matter is this Axion, it can convert into photons in a strong magnetic field (the Primakoff effect). We need to know the frequency to tune our radios.

### 5.1 The Frequency Calculation
$$\nu = \frac{m_a c^2}{h}$$
$$\nu \approx (1.0 \times 10^{-10} \text{ eV}) \times (2.418 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz/eV})$$
$$\nu \approx \mathbf{24 \text{ kHz}}$$

### 5.2 The Search Strategy
* **ADMX:** Searches in the GHz range ($\mu$eV). **Will see nothing.**
* **DM Radio / CASPEr:** Designed for low frequencies (kHz - MHz). **This is where the signal is.**
* **Signal Type:** A monochromatic, narrow-band signal at 24 kHz. It looks like a radio station that never plays music, just a hum.

## 6. Summary

Dark Matter is not a WIMP. It is not a complex dark sector.
It is the **Phase of the Geometry** ($Im(T)$).

1.  **It Solves Strong CP:** By canceling the $\theta_{QCD}$ term.
2.  **It Constitutes Dark Matter:** Via coherent oscillations.
3.  **It is Detectable:** As a VLF radio wave.

We are literally swimming in the hum of the extra dimensions.
