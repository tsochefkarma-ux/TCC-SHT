## Heterotic M-Theory on the Schoen Manifold ($Z_3 \times Z_3$)

This is all CONJECTURE any claims made within this are not claiming truths applicable to our universe, only to a universe that is governed by the Schoen Manifold. While it is still technically possible for this to be ours, the liklihood is... It isn't. This is a passion project first and foremost. Done by someone with absolutely 0 previous professional experience in either physics or mathematics.

## 1. Abstract

The **Computational Cosmos** is a unified framework that derives the fundamental constants of nature from the geometry of a specific Calabi-Yau manifold: the **Schoen Manifold** with a $Z_3 \times Z_3$ quotient.

By treating the speed of light ($c$) as a geometric bandwidth limit and the Planck Length ($l_P$) as a hard computational floor, the framework unifies **Standard Model Particle Physics**, **Cosmology**, and **Quantum Foundations** into a single geometric structure.

The theory requires **zero free parameters**. Every mass, coupling, and energy fraction is derived directly from the topological invariants ($h^{1,1}=3, N=25, \chi=0$) of the vacuum geometry.

## 2. The Golden Numbers (Derived vs. Observed)

The framework accurately post-dicts the fundamental constants of the universe without fitting.

| Observable | Symbol | Theory Prediction | Observed Value | Error | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dark Energy** | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | **66.7%** ($2/3$) | 68% | ~1.3% | Dimensional Exclusion |
| **Dark Matter** | $\Omega_{DM}$ | **27.8%** ($5/18$) | 27% | ~0.8% | String Coupling Residue |
| **Baryons** | $\Omega_b$ | **5.6%** ($1/18$) | 5% | ~0.6% | Topological Zero Modes |
| **Fine Structure** | $1/\alpha$ | **137** | 137.036 | < 0.1% | Vacuum Deficit ($N \times 6 - 13$) |
| **Lepton Ratio** | $m_\mu/m_e$ | **207** | 206.77 | 0.1% | Heterotic Product Space |
| **Hubble Constant**| $H_0$ | **71.1** | 70-73 | - | Moduli Evolution |
| **SUSY Scale** | $m_{3/2}$ | **55 TeV** | > 2 TeV | - | Split Moduli ($K=5$) |


*Note: The SUSY scale of 55 TeV comes from m_{3/2} = M_P × exp(-2π×5), where K=5 represents the dynamical moduli after one is used to fix the Planck scale.*

## 3. Repository Roadmap

This repository is organized into five pillars, moving from the mathematical foundation to experimental tests.

### [`01_Core_Framework/`](./01_Core_Framework)
**The Axioms.**
* Establishes the **Schoen Manifold** as the vacuum geometry.

## 4. The "Kill List" (Falsification)

This theory is not a philosophy; it is a physical model. It is falsified if:
1.  **Neutrinos** are found to have an **Inverted Hierarchy**.
2.  **Primordial Gravitational Waves** ($r > 0.01$) are detected (falsifying the Bounce).
3.  **Proton Decay** is observed in the $p \to K^+ \bar{\nu}$ channel (falsifying Split SUSY).
4.  **Dark Energy** is measured to be static ($w = -1.000$) to extreme precision.
