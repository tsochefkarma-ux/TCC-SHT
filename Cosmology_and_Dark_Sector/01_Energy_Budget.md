# The Energy Budget: The Geometric 12:5:1 Ratio

**Date:** December 2025
**Source:** Derived from Dimensional Exclusion in $K_6$
**Key Result:** The cosmic energy fractions are integer ratios of the vacuum geometry.

## 1. Executive Summary

In the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the composition of the universe is a mystery:
* Dark Energy $\approx 68\%$
* Dark Matter $\approx 27\%$
* Baryons $\approx 5\%$

Physics offers no explanation for why these numbers exist. In the **Computational Cosmos**, these fractions are derived from the dimensionality of the String Vacuum ($d=2$) and the Compact Space ($D=6$).

| Component | Symbol | Geometric Ratio | Derived % | Observed % |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dark Energy** | $\Omega_\Lambda$ | **4/6** | **66.7%** | 68% |
| **Dark Matter** | $\Omega_{DM}$ | **5/18** | **27.8%** | 27% |
| **Baryons** | $\Omega_b$ | **1/18** | **5.6%** | 5% |

The ratio is exact: **12 : 5 : 1**.

## 2. Dark Energy: Dimensional Exclusion (2/3)

Why is the universe mostly Dark Energy? Because fundamental strings are lower-dimensional than the space they inhabit.

### 2.1 The Geometry
* **Space ($D$):** The compact Calabi-Yau manifold has **6** real dimensions.
* **Matter ($d$):** Fundamental strings are **2-dimensional** objects (worldsheets).

### 2.2 The Exclusion Principle
A string can only vibrate (store energy) in dimensions parallel to its worldsheet.
* **Coupled Dimensions:** 2 dimensions align with the string. This energy manifests as **Matter**.
* **Orthogonal Dimensions:** $6 - 2 = 4$ dimensions are perpendicular to the worldsheet. The string cannot "push" against them.
* **The Result:** To any string-based observer (us), these 4 dimensions appear as inaccessible vacuum energy.

### 2.3 The Derivation
$$\Omega_\Lambda = \frac{\text{Vacuum Dimensions}}{\text{Total Dimensions}} = \frac{6 - 2}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \mathbf{66.7\%}$$

## 3. Total Matter: The Coupled Sector (1/3)

The remaining energy is the fraction of the geometry that *does* couple to strings.
$$\Omega_{Matter} = \frac{\text{String Dimensions}}{\text{Total Dimensions}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} = \mathbf{33.3\%}$$

This $33.3\%$ represents all "stuff" in the universe (Visible + Dark). We must now split this into Baryons and Dark Matter.

## 4. Baryons vs. Dark Matter (The 1:5 Split)

Why is most matter "Dark"? Because most of the geometry is topologically distinct from the Standard Model.

### 4.1 The Topological Weight
The Standard Model particles (Baryons) correspond to the "
